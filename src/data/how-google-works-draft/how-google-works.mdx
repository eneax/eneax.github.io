Quotes:

> It’s also true that many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, with a few incremental changes. This kind of incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, because change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary. So you need to force yourself to place big bets on the future.

> We have long felt that the start-up model, with small, autonomous teams located in one office led by passionate founders, is the most effective way to achieve remarkable new things (or fail quickly in the effort).

> Astro Teller often says that projects at X succeed only when they “fail to fail.” Each step along the way is an effort to make the project fail, to prove that it is flawed.

> “Go out there and have huge dreams, then show up to work the next morning and relentlessly incrementally achieve them.”

> But practically every industry is, at some level, information-driven. Media, marketing, retail, health care, government, education, financial services, transportation, defense, energy ... We can’t think of an industry that will escape this era unchanged.

> As Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, says: “In the old world, you devoted 30 percent of your time to building a great service and 70 percent of your time to shouting about it. In the new world, that inverts.”

> Product development has become a faster, more flexible process, where radically better products don’t stand on the shoulders of giants, but on the shoulders of lots of iterations. The basis for success then, and for continual product excellence, is speed.

> The primary objective of any business today must be to increase the speed of the product development process and the quality of its output.

> If you can’t tell someone how to think, then you have to learn to manage the environment where they think. And make it a place where they want to come every day.

> “it’s what you learn after you know it all that counts.” To be effective, they need to care about the place they > work. This is why, when starting a new company or initiative, culture is the most important thing to consider.

> Once established, company culture is very difficult to change, because early on in a company’s life a self-selection tendency sets in. People who believe in the same things the company does will be drawn to work there, while people who don’t, won’t.

> As former General Electric CEO Jack Welch said in Winning: “No vision is worth the paper it’s printed on unless it is communicated constantly and reinforced with rewards.”

> Offices should be designed to maximize energy and interactions, not for isolation and status. Since there is no perfect organizational design, don’t try to find one. Get as close as you can and let your smart creatives figure out the rest.

> “Your title makes you a manager. Your people make you a leader.”

> You want to invest in the people who are going to do what they think is right, whether or not you give them permission.

> When a CEO looks around her staff meeting, a good rule of thumb is that at least 50 percent of the people at the table should be experts in the company’s products and services and responsible for product development. This will help ensure that the leadership team maintains focus on product excellence. Operational components like finance, sales, and legal are obviously critical to a company’s success, but they should not dominate the conversation.

> You should never be able to reverse engineer a company’s organizational chart from the design of its product. Once you identify the people who have the biggest impact, give them more to do. When you pile more responsibility on your best people, trust that they will keep taking it on or tell you when enough is enough. As the old saying goes: If you want something done, give it to a busy person.

> The character of a company is the sum of the characters of its people, so if you strive for a company of sterling character, that is the standard you must set for your employees. There is no room for knaves. And generally, in our experience, once a knave, always a knave.

> burnout isn’t caused by working too hard, but by resentment at having to give up what really matters to you.

> Bet on technical insights that help solve a big problem in a novel way, optimize for scale, not for revenue, and let great products grow the market for everyone.

> A technical insight is a new way of applying technology or design that either drives down the cost or increases the functions and usability of the product by a significant factor.

> Giving the customer what he wants is less important than giving him what he doesn’t yet know he wants.

> “What is your technical insight?” turns out to be an easy question to ask and a hard one to answer. So for your products, ask the question. If you can’t articulate a good answer, rethink the product.

> (Hal Varian calls the Internet “a lab experiment that got loose.”) If you focus on your competition, you will never deliver anything > truly innovative.

> Nietzsche wrote in Thus Spake Zarathustra: “You must be proud of your enemy; then your enemy’s successes are also your successes.”90 Be proud of your competitors. Just don’t follow them.

> Start by asking what will be true in five years and work backward. Examine carefully the things you can assert will change quickly, especially factors of production where technology is exponentially driving down cost curves, or platforms that could emerge.

> Sergey asked one of his favorite interview questions: “Could you teach me something complicated I don’t know?”

> Ray Kurzweil said that “information technology’s growing exponentially ... And our intuition about the future is not exponential, it’s linear.”96 In our experience raw brainpower is the starting point for any exponential thinker. Intelligence is the best indicator of a person’s ability to handle change.

> Henry Ford said that “anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.”

> Favoring specialization over intelligence is exactly wrong, especially in high tech.

> “What big trend did you miss about the Internet in 1996? What did you get right, and what did you get wrong?”

> The most important skill any business person can develop is interviewing. The urgency of the role isn’t sufficiently important to compromise qualit> y in hiring.

> But what’s most important in the Internet Century is product excellence, so it follows that big rewards should be given to the people who are closest to great products and innovations. This means that yes, the lower-level employee who helps create a breakthrough product or feature should be very handsomely rewarded. Pay outrageously good people outrageously well, regardless of their title or tenure. What counts is their impact.

> Because people seldom leave over compensation, the first step to keeping them is to listen. They want to be heard, to be relevant and valued.

> As Reid Hoffman, Jonathan’s former colleague at Apple and founding CEO of LinkedIn notes, “Just because a job ends, your relationship with your employee doesn’t have to. ... The first thing you should do when a valuable employee tells you he is leaving is try to change his mind. The second is congratulate him on the new job and welcome him to your company’s alumni network.” So always keep in mind, from the outset, that the best> way to avoid having to fire underperformers is not to hire them.

> Tom Lehrer line—“Life is like a sewer: What you get out of it depends on what you put into it”

> Hal Varian notes that it is always a good idea for individuals to build expertise in areas that complement things that are getting cheap,

> People always say they don’t have the time to read, but what they are really saying is that they aren’t making it a priority to learn as much as they can about their business.

> For leaders, decisions are when the hard work begins; there’s a reason why the word “tough” is so often followed by “decision.” As General Patton famously said, “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.”

> As Coach Wooden once said, “Be interested in finding the best way, not in having your own way.”131

> you’re not sure if a course of action is right, the best thing you can do is try it out and then correct course.

> It was a critical decision, and when you are considering something that is fundamental to the existence of the company, you should meet every day. the self-review: At least once per year, write a review of your own performance, then read it and see if you would work for you. And then, share it with the people who do in fact work for you. This will elicit greater insights than the standard 360-degree review process, because when you are initiating criticism of yourself it gives others the freedom to be more honest.

> (Champion racecar driver Mario Andretti: “If everything seems under control, you’re just not going fast enough.”)

> To us, innovation entails both the production and implementation of novel and useful ideas.

> “Innovative people do not need to be told to do it, they need to be allowed to do it.” In other words, innovation has to evolve organically.

> A lack of resources forces ingenuity. Voltaire wrote, “The perfect is the e> nemy of the good.”

> As Larry says, if you are thinking big enough it is very hard to fail completely.

> “Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment.”

> As Jeff Bezos points out, “Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow — and we’re very stubborn. We say we’re stubborn on vision and flexible on details.” When information truly is ubiquitous, when reach and connectivity are completely global, when computing resources are infinite, and when a whole new set of impossibilities are not only possible, but happening, what will that do to your business?
