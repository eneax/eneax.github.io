## Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements

The `if/else` statement is very useful to deal with more than two options.
However, when we have many options to choose from, a `switch statement` is the ideal solution.

Example:

```js
function caseInSwitch(x) {
  var answer = '';

  switch (x) {
    case 1:
      return (answer = 'alpha');
      break;
    case 2:
      return (answer = 'beta');
      break;
    case 3:
      return (answer = 'gamma');
      break;
    case 4:
      return (answer = 'delta');
      break;
  }

  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
```

The value of `x` is checked for a strict equality (`===`) to the value from the first case (`1`), then to the second (`2`) and so on.
If the equality is found, `switch` starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch). If no case is matched then the `default` code is executed (if it exists).

In a `switch` statement, if we have many cases to deal with and we cannot specify all of them, we can add a `default`
statement. This statement will be executed only if no matching case statements are found.

We can think of `default` as the final `else` statement in an `if/else` scenario, since both the statements are the last case.

## Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements

If we omit the `break` statement from a switch statement's case, the `case`s will execute until a `break` is encountered.

This can be a handy solution if we have multiple identical options that we might prefer to group together.

Example:

```js
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  var answer = '';

  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      answer = 'Low';
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      answer = 'Mid';
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      answer = 'High';
      break;
  }

  return answer;
}

sequentialSizes(1);
```
