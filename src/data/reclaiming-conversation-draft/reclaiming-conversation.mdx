Quotes:

> We say we turn to our phones when we’re “bored.” And we often find ourselves bored because we have become accustomed to a constant feed of connection, information, and entertainment. We are forever elsewhere.

> “Students don’t seem to be making friendships as before. They make acquaintances, but their connections seem superficial.”

> Real people, with their unpredictable ways, can seem difficult to contend with after one has spent a stretch in simulation.

> From the early days, I saw that computers offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship and then, as the programs got really good, the illusion of friendship without the demands of intimacy.

> Time in simulation gets children ready for more time in simulation. Time with people teaches children how to be in a relationship, beginning with the ability to have a conversation.

> Conversation is on the path toward the experience of intimacy, community, and communion. Reclaiming conversation is a step toward reclaiming our most fundamental human values.

> In solitude we find ourselves; we prepare ourselves to come to conversation with something to say that is authentic, ours. When we are secure in ourselves we are able to listen to other people and really hear what they have to say. And then in conversation with other people we become better at inner dialogue.

> Solitude reinforces a secure sense of self, and with that, the capacity for empathy. Then, conversation with others provides rich material for self-reflection. Just as alone we prepare to talk together, together we learn how to engage in a more productive solitude.

> These days, we see that when people are alone at a stop sign or in the checkout line at the supermarket, they seem almost panicked and they reach for their phones. We are so accustomed to being always connected that being alone seems like a problem technology should solve.

> Afraid of being alone, we struggle to pay attention to ourselves. And what suffers is our ability to pay attention to each other. If we can’t find our own center, we lose confidence in what we have to offer others.

> “Don’t people know that sometimes you can just look out the window of a car and see the world go by and it’s wonderful?”

> Studies show that the mere presence of a phone on the table (even a phone turned off) changes what people talk about. If we think we might be interrupted, we keep conversations light, on topics of little controversy or consequence.

> Studies show that when children hear less adult talk, they talk less.

> Research tells us that being comfortable with our vulnerabilities is central to our happiness, our creativity, and even our productivity.

> Research shows that those who use social media the most have difficulty reading human emotions, including their own.

> Eye contact is the most powerful path to human connection.

> the experience of boredom is directly linked to creativity and innovation.

> Every time you check your phone in company, what you gain is a hit of stimulation, a neurochemical shot, and what you lose is what a friend, teacher, parent, lover, or co-worker just said, meant, felt.

> So, instead of doing your email as you push your daughter in her stroller, talk to her. Instead of putting a digital tablet in your son’s baby bouncer, read to him and chat about the book. Instead of a quick text if you find a conversation going stale, make an effort to engage your peers.

> Language . . . has created the word ‘loneliness’ to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word ‘solitude’ to express the glory of being alone.”

> To reclaim solitude we have to learn to experience a moment of boredom as a reason to turn inward, to defer going “elsewhere” at least some of the time.

> The psychoanalytic tradition makes us aware of our human tendency to see the world through the prism of what our most significant relationships have told us about ourselves.

> The psychoanalytic tradition suggests that action before self-understanding is rarely a good way to improve one’s situation.

> If you act out, you create change and perhaps crisis. All of the new noise you make can drown out the feelings you were originally trying to understand. Nevertheless, it is often what people try first.

> When digital media encourage us to edit ourselves until we have said the “right thing,” we can lose sight of the important thing: Relationships deepen not because we necessarily say anything in particular but because we are invested enough to show up for another conversation.

> Wherever she and her friends are, they strategize about where they could be. With so much choice, says Kati, it becomes harder to choose, because “you’re afraid you won’t make the right choice.” And nothing seems like the right choice. Nothing Kati and her friends decide seems to measure up to their fantasy of what they might have done.

> This is our paradox. When we are apart: hypervigilance. When we are together: inattention.

> The psychologists David Myers and Robert Lane independently concluded that in American society today, abundance of choice (and this would apply to choices in products, career paths, or people) often leads to depression and feelings of loneliness

> So, the problem with infinite choice is that it makes us unhappy because we can’t bring ourselves to make any choice, and no choice feels definitive.

> a life lived online makes deep attention harder to summon. This happens because the brain is plastic—it is constantly in flux over a lifetime—so it “rewires” itself depending on how attention is allocated.

> For if the brain is plastic, this means that at any age, it can be set to work on deep attention. Put otherwise, if we decide that deep attention is a value, we can cultivate it.

> And even if every one of their students will always have the web by their side, these educators insist that on-demand information does not make an education. You need to have a strong background of facts and concepts on board before you know you need them We think with what we know; we use what we know to ask new questions.

> “To remain vital, culture must be renewed in the minds of the members of every generation. Outsource memory, and culture withers.”

> when the day comes that machines are able to take notes for us, it will not serve our purposes, because note taking is part of how we learn to think.

> Again, technology makes us forget what we know about life. We become enchanted by technology’s promises because we have so many problems we would like technology to solve.

> And you learn the rewards of patience: You have followed arguments as they unfold. If you are lucky, you learn that life repays close, focused attention.

> As the consultant sees it: When people get together, they do their “part” and then check out.

> “In all of this silence, as you are emailing the people you work with, you lose the nuance of conversation and you lose the ability to see how someone thinks on their feet.”

> In a world where everyone “knows” that multitasking is bad for you but doesn’t do anything about it, things change if your employer tells you that you are going to be given the time, space, and privacy to begin and complete important tasks one by one.

> Sometimes making conversation an explicit value means recognizing when our best interests conflict with our desire to stay on our phones.

> Encouraging conversation gives you permission to encourage solitude. Give yourself and others permission to think—sometimes alone—and provide time and space to do so.

> If people always look to others for validation, they don’t develop the confidence to develop creatively.

> “The trouble with socialism is that it takes too many evenings.” Social networks enable a new fantasy: that online, even socialism can take a shortcut. But it is only that, a fantasy.

> The story about life as emergencies is about how people, especially young people, develop a fretful self. If you see life as a stream of emergencies, this frames your life narrative.

> “Most of the emergencies that are broadcast on the media, you can’t do anything about. There’s no action you know how to take that would improve the actual circumstances.” This does much to explain how the fretful self navigates the media stream of bad news: We learn about something, get anxious, and connect online.

> When terrorism is presented as a calamity, and it is, it is presented as separate from the history that created it, so that it comes to be more like a natural disaster, a state of evil, rather than something that can be addressed by politics or through a reconsideration of its historical roots. When terror is treated as a natural disaster, all we can do about it is kill terrorists.

> These days, our online practices put us in a world where the real question is “What do you have to give today?” What information about yourself will you offer up today? We exist alongside digital representations of ourselves—digital doubles—that are useful to different parties at different times, or for some, at a time to be determined. The digital self is archived forever.

> The philosopher Allan Bloom has suggested the cost: “Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even especially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity, but the one that removes awareness of other possibilities.”

> In conversations with others over a lifetime, you get to see yourself as others see you. You get to “meet yourself” in new ways. You get to object on the spot if somebody doesn’t “get you.” Now we are offered a new experience: We are asked to see ourselves as the collection of things we are told we should want, as the collection of things we are told should interest us. Is this a tidier version of identity?

> The mere presence of a phone signals that your attention is divided, even if you don’t intend it to be. It will limit the conversation in many ways: how you’ll listen, what will be discussed, the degree of connection you’ll feel. Rich conversations have difficulty competing with even a silent phone. To clear a path for conversation, set aside laptops and tablets. Put away your phone.

> Slow down. Some of the most crucial conversations you will ever have will be with yourself. To have them, you have to learn to listen to your own voice. A first step is to slow down sufficiently to make this possible.

> Our minds work, and sometimes at their best, when we daydream. When you return from reverie, you may be bringing back something deeply pertinent.

> Conversation, like life, has silences and boring bits. This bears repeating: It is often in the moments when we stumble and hesitate and fall silent that we reveal ourselves to each other.

> A child alone with a problem has an emergency. A child in conversation with a grown-up is facing a moment in life and learning how to cope with it.

> Again, children interact with sociable robots not with the psychology of projection but with engagement. They react as though they face another person.

> People are lonely and fear intimacy, and robots seem ready to hand. And we are ready for their company if we forget what intimacy is.

> Nurturance turns out to be a “killer app.” Once we take care of a digital creature or teach or amuse it, we become attached to it, and then behave “as if” the creature cares for us in return.

> What is the value of an interaction that contains no shared experience of life and contributes nothing to a shared store of human meaning—and indeed may devalue it?
