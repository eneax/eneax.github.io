Favorite quotes from the [book](https://amzn.eu/55qF82l):

> From boyhood, Oleg saw that it was possible to live a double life, to love those around while concealing your true inner self, to appear to be one person to the external world and quite another inside.

> 'Only a physical barrier, reinforced by armed guards in their watchtowers, could keep the East Germans in their socialist paradise and stop them fleeing to the West.

> “It is perfectly possible for two people to listen to the same words and hear entirely different things.”
