Franz Kafka's story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family and a stranger in his own home.

Favorite quote from the [book](https://amzn.eu/ekT6BWe):

> “I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.”
