by Isaac Asimov

Quotes:

> There was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend. Now he has creatures to help him; stronger creatures than himself, more faithful, more useful, and absolutely devoted to him. Mankind is no longer alone.

> First Law of Robotics. You know that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human being;

> One, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”

> “Two,” continued Powell, “a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.”

> “And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.”

> The First Law states—I’ll quote it—‘No robot may harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.’

> “Every period of human development, Susan,” said the Co-ordinator, “has had its own particular type of human conflict—its own variety of problem that, apparently, could be settled only by force. And each time, frustratingly enough, force never really settled the problem. Instead, it persisted through a series of conflicts, then vanished of itself,—what’s the expression,—ah, yes ‘not with a bang, but a whimper,’ as the economic and social environment changed. And then, new problems, and a new series of wars. —Apparently endlessly cyclic.

> People say ‘It’s as plain as the nose on your face.’ But how much of the nose on your face can you see, unless someone holds a mirror up to you?
