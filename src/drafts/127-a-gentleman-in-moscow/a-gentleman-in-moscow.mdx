Favorite quotes from the book:

> "A king fortifies himself with a castle," observed the Count, "a gentleman with a desk."

> But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest posses sions adieu. And if it were to? We wouldn't welcome the education. For eventually, we come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity-all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance.

> "If only I were there and she were here," she sighed. And there, thought the Count, was a suitable plaint for all mankind.

> The fashions and attitudes that had seemed so alien to him are suddenly swept aside and supplanted by fashions and attitudes in perfect sympathy with his deep st sentiments. Then, like a lone sailor adrift for years on alien seas, he wakes one night to discover familiar constellations overhead.

> After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we've just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration-and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.

> As we age, we are bound to find comfort from the notion that it takes generations for a way of life to fade We are familiar with the songs our grandparents favored, after all, even though we never danced to them our selves. At festive holidays, the recipes we pull from the drawer are rou tinely decades old, and in some cases even written in the hand of a relative long since dead.

> But under certain circumstances, the Count finally acknowledged this process can occur in the comparative blink of an eye. Popular upheaval. political turmoil, industrial progress-any combination of these can cause the evolution of a society to leapfrog generations, sweeping aside aspects of the past that might otherwise have lingered for decades.

> It is a fact of human life that one must eventually choose a philosophy.

> Whether through careful consideration spawned by books and spir ited debate over coffee at two in the morning, or simply from a natural proclivity, we must all eventually adopt a fundamental framework, some reasonably coherent system of causes and effects that will help us make sense not simply of momentous events, but of all the little actions and interactions that constitute our daily lives-be they deliberate or sponta neous, inevitable or unforeseen.

> "It's all right, Alexander. You were anxious because you haven't spent time with children before. But I am certain that you are up to the chal lenge. If you are ever in doubt, just remember that unlike adults, children want to be happy. So they still have the ability to take the greatest plea sure in the simplest things."

> "I'll tell you what is convenient," he said after a moment. " To sleep until noon and have someone bring you your breakfast on a tray. To cancel an appointment at the very last minute. To keep a carriage waiting at the door of one party, so that on a moment's notice it can whisk you away to another. To sidestep marriage in your youth and put off having children altogether. These are the greatest of conveniences, Anushka-and at one time, I had them all. But in the end, it has been the inconveniences that have mattered to me most."

> He had said that our lives are steered by uncer tainties, many of which are disruptive or even daunting, but that if we persevere and remain generous of heart, we may be granted a moment of supreme lucidity-a moment in which all that has happened to us sed denly comes into focus as a necessary course of events, even as we find ourselves on the threshold of a bold new life that we had been meant to lead all along.

> If one has been absent for decades from a place that one once held dear, the wise would generally counsel that one should never return there again.

> Why after so many years of longing for home did these sojourners aban don it so shortly upon their return? It is hard to say. But perhaps for those returning after a long absence, the combination of heartfelt sentiments and the ruthless influence of time can only spawn disappointments. The land scape is not as beautiful as one remembered it. The local cider is not as sweet. Quaint buildings have been restored beyond recognition, while fine old tra ditions have lapsed to make way for mystifying new entertainments. And having imagined at one time that one resided at the very center of this little universe, one is barely recognized, if recognized at all. Thus do the wise counsel that one should steer far and wide of the old homestead.

> But no counsel, however well grounded in history, is suitable for all. Like bottles of wine, two men will differ radically from each other for being born a year apart or on neighboring hills.

> By way of example, as this traveler stood before the ruins of his old home, he was not overcome by shock, indignation, or despair. Rather, he exhibited the same smile, at once wistful and serene, that he had exhibited upon seeing the overgrown road. For as it turns out, one can revisit the past quite pleasantly, as long as one does so expecting nearly every aspect of it to have changed.
