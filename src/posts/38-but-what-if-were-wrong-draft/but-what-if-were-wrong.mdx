But What If We're Wrong?
by Chuck Klosterman
Preview: 'http://amzn.to/1UxRrbs'

Quotes:

> If mankind could believe something false was objectively true for two thousand years, why do we reflexively assume that our current understanding of gravity — which we’ve embraced for a mere three hundred fifty years — will somehow exist forever?

> Is it possible that this type of problem has simply been solved? What if Newton’s answer really is — more or less — the final answer, and the only one we will ever need? Because if that is true, it would mean we’re at the end of a process that has defined the experience of being alive. It would mean certain intellectual quests would no longer be necessary.

> The practical reality is that any present-tense version of the world is unstable. What we currently consider to be true — both objectively and subjectively — is habitually provisional.

> We live in an age where virtually no content is lost and virtually all content is shared. The sheer amount of information about every current idea makes those concepts difficult to contradict, particularly in a framework where public consensus has become the ultimate arbiter of validity. In other words, we’re starting to behave as if we’ve reached the end of human knowledge. And while that notion is undoubtedly false, the sensation of certitude it generates is paralyzing.

> It’s impossible to understand the world of today until today has become tomorrow.

> Klosterman’s Razor: the philosophical belief that the best hypothesis is the one that reflexively accepts its potential wrongness to begin with.

> Language is more durable than content. Words outlive their definitions.

> The reason something becomes retrospectively significant in a far-flung future is detached from the reason it was significant at the time of its creation—and that’s almost always due to a recalibration of social ideologies that future generations will accept as normative.

> What if the greatest writer of this generation is someone who will die totally unknown?

> what if the greatest writer of this generation is a known figure, but a figure taken seriously by no one alive (including, perhaps, the writer in question)?

> A book becomes popular because of its text, but it’s the subtext that makes it live forever.

> History is a creative process (or as Napoleon Bonaparte once said, “a set of lies agreed upon”). The world happens as it happens, but we construct what we remember and what we forget. And people will eventually do that to us, too.

> History is defined by people who don’t really understand what they are defining.

> To matter forever, you need to matter to those who don’t care. And if that strikes you as sad, be sad.

> everyone concedes we have the potential to be subjectively wrong about anything, as long as we don’t explicitly name whatever that something is.

> Will our current understanding of how space and time function eventually seem as absurd as Aristotle’s assertion that a brick doesn’t float because the ground is the “natural” place a brick wants to be?

> every age thinks they were making real headway toward the ultimate answer, and every next generation comes along and says, “You were really insightful, but now that we know X, Y, and Z, here is what we actually think.”

> What we believe to be reality is actually a computer simulation, constructed in a future where artificial intelligence is so advanced that those living inside the simulation cannot tell the difference. Essentially, we would all be characters in a supernaturally sophisticated version of The Sims or Civilization, where the constructed characters—us—are self-aware and able to generate original thoughts and feelings. But none of this would be real, in the way that term is traditionally used. And this would be true for all of history and all of space.

> What Bostrom is asserting is that there are three possibilities about the future, one of which must be true. The first possibility is that the human race becomes extinct before reaching the stage where such a high-level simulation could be built. The second possibility is that humans do reach that stage, but for whatever reason— legality, ethics, or simple disinterest—no one ever tries to simulate the complete experience of civilization. The third possibility is that we are living in a simulation right now.

> Discounting those events that occurred within your own lifetime, what do you know about human history that was not communicated to you by someone else?

> Mad Men cannot show us what life was like in the sixties. Mad Men can only show how life in the sixties came to be interpreted in the twenty-first century.

> Something becomes truly popular when it becomes interesting to those who don’t particularly care.

> smart people tend to be wrong as often as their not-so-smart peers — they work from the flawed premise that their worldview is standard.

> Should physical differences matter more than intellectual differences? Should the ability to intimidate another person be rewarded? Is it acceptable to scream at a person in order to shape his behavior? Should masculinity, in any context, be prioritized? The growing consensus regarding all of these questions is no. Yet these are ingrained aspects of competitive sports, all the way back to Sparta.

> We want a pain-free world where everyone is the same, even if they are not. That can’t happen if we’re still keeping score.

> “It is the opposite, we are born unequal, and the conditions of life make us more equal.”

> For any lone individual, voting is a symbolic act that retains its illusionary power from everyone else agreeing that it’s indispensable.

> The ultimate failure of the United States will probably not derive from the problems we see or the conflicts we wage. It will more likely derive from our uncompromising belief in the things we consider unimpeachable and idealized and beautiful. Because every strength is a weakness, if given enough time.

> The amplification of available information and the increase in communication speed was obvious to everyone. We talked about it constantly. What was harder to recognize was how the Internet slowly reinvented the way people thought about everything, including those things that have no relationship to the Internet whatsoever.

> When you see the phrase “You’re doing it wrong,” the unwritten sentence that follows is: “And I’m doing it right.” Which has become the pervasive way to argue about just about everything, particularly in a Web culture where discourse is dominated by the reaction to (and the rejection of) other people’s ideas, as opposed to generating one’s own.

> I realize certain modes of thinking can become outdated. But outdated modes are essential to understanding outdated times, which are the only times that exist.

> Consciously trying to keep up with what’s happening might actually make things worse. We spend our lives learning many things, only to discover (again and again) that most of what we’ve learned is either wrong or irrelevant. A big part of our mind can handle this; a smaller, deeper part cannot. And it’s that smaller part that matters more, because that part of our mind is who we really are (whether we like it or not).
