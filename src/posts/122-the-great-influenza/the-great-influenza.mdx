Then as now people isolated themselves at home, streets were empty, and industry shut down. Doctors and nurses were incredibly heroic, putting their own lives at risk and working themselves to the bone. The best parts of human nature were frequently on display—but so were acts of ignorance, greed, and fear of the “other.”

Barry speculates that if not for the pandemic, World War II might never have erupted. In 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson was in the midst of negotiating with his British and French counterparts the treaty to end World War I, he got a violent case of the flu. He survived, but he was never the same again, physically or mentally. Previously, Wilson had insisted that the treaty must represent “peace without victory” and would not give in to the harsh terms French President Georges Clemenceau wanted to impose on the Germans. But after getting the flu, Wilson “yielded to Clemenceau everything of significance Clemenceau wanted,” Barry writes.

No one can know for sure what effect the flu really had on Wilson, or what the effect of a gentler Treaty of Versailles might have been. But Barry is sure that Wilson’s illness contributed to the rise of Hitler: “Historians with virtual unanimity agree that the harshness toward Germany of the Paris peace treaty helped create the economic hardship, nationalistic reaction, and political chaos that fostered the rise of Adolf Hitler.”

So what are the big lessons from the 1918 influenza pandemic?

First and foremost, leadership matters. Scientific leaders like Army Surgeon General William Gorgas stepped up. And so did some, but by no means all, governors and mayors. In St. Louis, for example, the city mobilized quickly and staged effective responses that saved many lives. In Philadelphia, in contrast, the mayor ignored the advice of experts that he should cancel a massive parade in support of the war effort. A few days later, the bodies started piling up. “Undertakers, themselves sick, were overwhelmed. They had no place to put bodies…. Undertakers’ work areas were overflowing, they stacked caskets in halls, in their living quarters,” writes Barry.

Second, truth matters. In 1918, America’s political leaders—even health commissioners—sugarcoated bad news to avoid panicking the public. That greatly undermined their authority when citizens saw friends and neighbors dying in great numbers. Barry concludes that “those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one.”

Third, philanthropy has an important role to play. In fact, things could have been much worse if not for the gifts of John D. Rockefeller, Johns Hopkins, and many other donors. These gifts fundamentally transformed American science and medicine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries giving the country hundreds of thousands of well-trained professionals to treat those who fell ill from influenza and guide the public-health response.

Fourth, pandemics are humbling. Despite the brilliant work at the Rockefeller Institute, Johns Hopkins University, and other institutions, doctors never had the benefit of effective antiviral medications or a vaccine. In fact, it was not until 1933 that scientists confirmed that it was a virus, rather than a bacterium, that caused the influenza pandemic.

This time around, we have many more tools at our disposal for creating effective vaccines and therapeutics. But the science is still slower than any of us would like, and putting an end to this pandemic will require more than just great science. It will also take a lot of political will, especially encouraging social distancing and making sure that scientific miracles spread as far and wide as the virus itself.

Below are my favorite quotes from the book:

> Influenza killed more people in a year than the Black Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century; it killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years.

> In no area did the truth threaten so much as in the study of life. In no area did the United States lag behind the rest of the world so much as in its study of the life sciences and medicine.

> If a society does set Goethe's "Word... supremely high," if it believes that it knows the truth and that it need not question its beliefs, then that society is more likely to enforce rigid decrees, and less likely to change. If it leaves room for doubt about the truth, it is more likely to be free and open.

> But if the first failing of medicine, a failing that endured virtually unchallenged for two millennia and then only gradually eroded over the next three centuries, was that it did not probe nature through experi ments, that it simply observed and reasoned from observation to a con clusion, that failing was-finally-about to be corrected.

> Echoing Hunter's advice to Jenner, Bernard, a physiologist, told one American student, "Why think? Exhaustively experiment, then think.")

> Jacob Henle, the first scientist to formulate the modern germ theory, echoed Francis Bacon when he said, "Nature answers only when she is questioned."

> Influenza is a viral disease. When it kills, it usually does so in one of two ways: either quickly and directly with a violent viral pneumonia so damaging that it has been compared to burning the lungs; or more slowly and indirectly by stripping the body of defences, allowing bacteria to invade the lungs and cause a more common and slower-killing bacterial pneumonia.

> Simply put, the germ theory said that minute living organisms invaded the body, multiplied, and caused disease, and that a specific germ caused a specific disease.

> Viruses are themselves an enigma that exist on the edges of life. They are not simply small bacteria. Bacteria consist of only one cell, but they are fully alive. Each has a metabolism, requires food, produces waste, and reproduces by division.

> Viruses do not eat or burn oxygen for energy. They do not engage in any process that could be considered metabolic. They do not produce waste. They do not have sex. They make no side products, by accident or design. They do not even reproduce independently. They are less than a fully living organism but more than an inert collection of chemicals.

> Whatever the origin, a virus has only one function: to replicate itself. But unlike other life forms (if a virus is considered a life form), a virus does not even do that itself. It invades cells that have energy and then, ke some alien puppet master, it subverts them, takes them over, forces them to make thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of new viruses. The power to do this lies in their genes.

> Influenza is an RNA virus. So are HIV and the coronavirus. And of all RNA viruses, influenza and HIV are among those that mutate the fast est. The influenza virus mutates so fast that 99 percent of the 100,000 to I million new viruses that burst out of a cell in the reproduction process are too defective to infect another cell and reproduce again. But that still leaves between 1,000 and 10.000 viruses that can infect another cell.

> Both influenza and HIV fit the concept of a quasi species, of a mutant swarm. In both, a drug-resistant mutation can emerge within days. And the influenza virus reproduces rapidly-far faster than HIV. Therefore it adapts rapidly as well, often too rapidly for the immune system to respond.

> "Once lead this people into war, and they'll forget there ever was such a thing as tolerance. To fight you must be brutal and ruthless, and the spirit of ruthless brutality will enter into the very fibre of our national life. infecting Congress, the courts, the policeman on the beat, the man in the street."

> Wilson declared, "It isn't an army we must shape and train for war, it is a nation."

> As Einstein once said, "One of the strongest motives that lead persons to art or science is a flight from the everyday life.... With this negative motive goes a positive one. Man seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling personal experience."

> Man might be defined as "modern" largely to the extent that he attempts to control, as opposed to adjust himself to, nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.

> By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.

> In 1918 all infectious disease was frightening. Americans had already learned that "Spanish influenza" was serious enough that it had slowed the German offensive. Rumors now unsettled the city that these deaths too came from Spanish influenza. Those in control of the war's propaganda machine wanted nothing printed that could hurt morale. Two physicians stated flatly to newspapers that the men had not died of influenza. They were lying.

> How does one know when one knows? When one is on the edge, one cannot know. One can only test.

> "Whenever you fall, pick up something." And he often said, "Disappointment is my daily bread. I thrive on it."

> In virtually every home, someone was ill. People were already avoid ing each other, turning their heads away if they had to talk, isolating themselves. The telephone company increased the isolation: with eigh teen hundred telephone company employees out, the phone company allowed only emergency calls: operators listened to calls randomly and cut off phone service of those who made routine calls. And the isolation increased the fear. Clifford Adams recalled, "They stopped people from communicating, from going to churches, closed the schools, ... closed all the saloons. ... Everything was quiet."

> Fear began to break down the community of the city. Trust broke down. Signs began to surface of not just edginess but anger, not just finger-pointing or protecting one's own interests but active selfishness in the face of general calamity. The hundreds of thousands sick in the city became a great weight dragging upon it. And the city began to implode in chaos and fear.

> But by now the city had heard enough pleas, and had withdrawn into itself. There was no trust, no trust, and without trust all human relations were breaking down.

> It was a time when the phrase "brisk fighting" meant that more than 50 percent of a unit was killed or wounded; a time when the memoir of a nurse at the front, published in 1916, was withdrawn by her publisher after America entered the war because she told the truth about gruesome conditions; a time when newspapers insisted, "There is plenty of gasoline and oil for automobile use," even while gas stations were ordered to close "voluntarily" at night and Sundays and a national campaign was being waged against driving on "gasless Sundays"-and police pulled over motorists who did not "voluntarily" comply.

> Newspapers reported on the disease with the same mixture of truth and half-truth, truth and distortion, truth and lies with which they re ported everything else. And no national official ever publicly acknowledged the danger of influenza.

> It completely destroyed all family and community life. People were afraid to kiss one another people were afraid to eat with one another, they were afraid to have anything that made contact because that's how you got the flu....

> It destroyed those contacts and destroyed the intimacy that existed amongst people.... You were constantly afraid, you were afraid because you saw so much death around you, you were surrounded by death....

> When each day dawned you didn't know whether you would be there when the sun set that day. It wiped out entire families from the time that the day began in the morning to bedtime at night-entire families were gone completely, there wasn't any single soul left, and that didn't happen just intermittently, it happened all the way across the neighborhoods, it was a terrifying experience. It justifiably should be called a plague be cause that's what it was. ... You were quarantined, is what you were, from fear, it was so quick, so sudden.... There was an aura of a constant fear that you lived through from getting up in the morning to going to bed at night."

> "If the epidemic continues its mathematical rate of acceleration, civilization could easily," he wrote in hand, "disappear... from the face of the earth within a matter of a few more weeks."

> Influenza did visit the peace conference. Influenza did strike Wilson. Influenza did weaken him physically, and precisely at the most crucial point of negotiations-influenza did at the least drain from him stamina and the ability to concentrate. That much is certain. And it is almost certain that influenza affected his mind in other, deeper ways.

> People write about war. They write about the Holocaust. They write about horrors that people inflict on people. Apparently they forget the horrors that nature inflicts on people, the horrors that make humans least significant. And yet the pandemic resonated. When the Nazis took control of Germany in 1933, Christopher Isherwood wrote of Berlin:

> "The whole city lay under an epidemic of discreet, infectious fear. I could feel it, like influenza, in my bones."

> Those historians who have examined epidemics and analyzed how societies have responded to them have generally argued that those with power blamed the poor for their own suffering, and sometimes tried to stigmatize and isolate them.

> Those in power, historians have ob served, often sought security in imposing order, which gave them some feeling of control, some feeling that the world still made sense.

> So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to exe cute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that.

> Those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best.

> A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.
